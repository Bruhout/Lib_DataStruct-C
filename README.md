# Lib_DataStruct-C
Right now only has linked lists and hash tables implemented, soon adding many more data structures. Next up will be a two way linked list.

To get started:

      Including the functions headers
            1. Within the include folder, header files for the libraries are present.
            2. These header files have function headers for the functionality of the library.
            3. Copy these files into your proeject folder and ```#include ""``` into your project.

      Compiling the files
            1. Within the src folder, the actual implementaions for the library functions are present.
                  |In older to compile the library into .o file, execute "make linked_list.o" in your console, or just copy paste the command into your console. 
            2. These must be compiled separately first to get an .o file.
            3. When linking your project, link with is .o file as well.
