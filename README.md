# Lib_DataStruct-C
Right now only has linked lists implemented, soon adding Hash table in conjunction with linked lists and more.

To get started:
1. Include the linked_list.h header file
2. Link against linked_list.a in your compiler (On arm64 computers)
3. Otherwise, build the main.c file with the following command

   gcc -o linked_list.o linked_list.c -c

Source code contained in main.c.

Now link against linked_list.o.
